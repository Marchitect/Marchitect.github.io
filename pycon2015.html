##1st Time Experience
Okay, actually PyCon AU 2015 is also the first tech-conference for me. It was a bit exciting. Because it has created exclusive memories in my brain. However I haven't realised how cool Python is yet because up to this post is written I haven't been involved in any real project and done much exciting things in Python yet. What have I done in Python so far is basically a command line tool on HTML colour code and a not so funny 2D game with pyglet. 

I was one among the audience of other excellent geeks' talks. I talked to a few nice and cool people who are also Python enthusiasts. I got an UTAS former graduates' business card. I have take some but not much notes. Like "test starts from the single components, then components combined, finally things should run correctly at every level. " and "Python 3 supports unicode". 

To conclude, it was valuable experience. It is a friendly environment for beginners, job-seekers and such. 


##Do Things That Excite You
Some people are lucky enough to find things that excite them in an early age – not for me until now I am in my early 20s. You know the feeling of excitement; a feeling that makes you happy but more than happy. I haven't done drugs so I would say this kind of excitement feels like I was on drugs – NO I never want to try drugs. And what's even better, compared to drugs, is this kind of excitement does no harm to the body. So yeah, go ahead and find things excite you. So you work better, create better and live a better life – the kind of life you want to live. Be excited everyday, is that even possible? I hope it is a yes. 


##Others
Caxton St, just near my accommodation: the Street of Bars! I went out to buy some said-to-be New York style pizza slices on this street after 9pm. And saw alcohol-enlightened people here and there. If I lived in Hobart near the Princes Wharf and Salamanca, I wouldn't be writing about this bar street and feeling a bit scared to see these people. Yes, drunk people near bars are linked with irrational and disrespectful behaviours in my mind. Lucky that I haven't come across teenagers driving, or they might embarrass you with words I partially understand. I have been through this in Hobart twice. I'm just glad not all teenagers behave abominably to an Asian-looking person like me.
