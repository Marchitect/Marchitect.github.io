##What are the recommended SEO practices or directions for a smart web developer who thinks about boosting businesses, on top of responsibly building those good-looking sites for your customers?

###As a new SEO student, I have summarised the following from what I have read and learnt from the book 'SEO for Growth', udemy.com plus personal work experience. I hope I will gain more wonderful knowledge on my continuing journey of learning SEO.

####Rules

- Google wants to optimise user experience, therefore Google aims to highly rank those websites that put user experience on the first page.
- Websites need to have quality content to standout in the sea of information for the Google search engine. But how to define 'quality content'? To begin with, this means well-written articles that highly relate to your business' keywords. Content marketing is another broad realm of knowledge which I need to learn more about and write about in near future.

####Practices

- Pay attention to "above the fold", which refers to anything that a user sees when they land on your webpage for the first time without any scrolling (Tim Allen, Life Above and Beyond The Fold). Consider placing clear 'call to action' buttons or text. Those 'call to action' sections play the role of converting new website visitors into sales, inquiries, followers or subscribers. Other things to consider are online forms, introductory texts wrapped in h1, h2 or h3 tags, special offers, client testimonials etc.
- In order for search engines to know your webpages are relevant for specific keywords, you must include those keywords in your text, titles, metatags, images titles, alts and descriptions, URLs and anchor texts. Optimize each page for one expression only, otherwise you will confuse search engines (www.udemy.com/seo-course-for-beginners).
- A sitemap.xml will help search engines index your website’s pages. And robots.txt’s will help you keep the robots away from pages you don’t want indexed (www.udemy.com/seo-course-for-beginners).
- Title tags and meta descriptions should not be neglected. Put as many keywords as possible, but also pay attention to character length limits.
- Search engines favour Mobile-friendly sites and SSL-enabled sites.
- Website loading speed is important, so do speed tests where necessary.
- Your website should have a /blog section that provides useful and quality content on a regular basis.
- Engage in social media channels for increased visibility.
- Inbound marketing: This is often not the web developer's responsibility but web agencies should be aware that those customers aiming for a good-looking, competitively priced website are those who really need you to point them in the right direction. The purpose of running websites is about more than showing potential customers front-end tricks and decorations. Without SEO newly designed websites, no matter how pretty, will sink into the deep sea of information.
