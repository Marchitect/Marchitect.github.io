##Preface:
I have always been obsessed with two activities human beings are not capable of performing without the help of equipments: flying and diving deep. During the teenage years of my life, the best dreams I had before waking up from a sleep were the ones where I could fly and swim. 

This short sci-fi story is titled “Diving Deep”, for I am often attracted by quiet and mysterious beings, such as cats, introverts, and the ocean. It was firstly written in Chinese, March 2013, as a short story. I plan to rewrite it in English, and have plans to further integrate it into a novel (novel > short story), which I haven’t sketched out all the general plots yet. The plan also includes designing art works and illustrations for this short story, and further making it an independent game. Rewriting it in English was a somewhat huge task for me during my spare time. 

In one of my teenage morning dreams I was diving and looking down the huge water body under me, hesitating whether I should dive deeper. 

“NOW it is time to go deeper,” I keep telling myself. 

For sci-fi story creation, the part I’m most concerned about is whether my story contains sensible and logical science facts and assumptions. I personally feel that it would be a joke for a sci-fi writer if the story intended to derive things out of approachable reality contains obviously wrong statements or absurd assumptions (anther type of sci-fi stories are highly imaginative or philosophical so they have less risks to commit such kind of mistakes). Therefore, it would be very helpful if the readers of my crude stories can point out anything illogical or obviously against existing scientific facts. 

Rewriting feels very different from translating. Well, wish you enjoy my writing. 


##The Training

When I opened my eyes, I got all my senses. I felt that all my body parts below the neck were immersed into water under optimum temperature. The VOPP529 was floating in the air above my head. 

VOPP529 was my code in a project named Violet Ocean Plant Project (VOPP), and the code of my assigned own robot as well. At the age of 6, after VOPP529’s first major upgrade I was permitted to rename it Beatty. The VOPP had been undertaken for over two decades by EAGENE Inc., which was supported by a few governments, but protested by some other governments at the same time. 

I was created at the beginning of VOPP, together with some other people similar to me. 

We have common features, such as four lungs inside the chest. 

I looked down, and all I saw was the immense, endless, deep violet water body. It was dawn time, the surface of the ocean was reflecting an enchanting pink colour, which represented the weakening radiation from the Sun of this galaxy. Ahead of me, by zooming my vision I could also tell a small range of shallower water bodies, from which the rocks underneath were showing a clear and gentle profile. Tiny and elaborate plankton were swimming above the rocks comfortably, as if they had nothing to worry about.  

Who do we belong to? You can say we belong to EAGENE Inc., but what else? Who am I?

I have never stopped asking myself this question, but never got an answer, so far. Maybe I am just a product of my age. Maybe I am created, or born, for a purpose, which is to explore the SL0312c, “the Violet Ocean Planet”. I felt myself pushed by the power above me, living my life with no other choices. We were born bound to the mysterious, violent, far-away land, or say ocean. After the failure of the second inter-planetary immigration project of human beings, we, or as called “the Fismen” by some humans, had become the hope of some, and the curse of the others. Those who supported the VOPP and our existence claimed that as long as human beings can survive in today’s world where the Earth is accepted by most humans as no longer being habitable, GM humans are acceptable, regardless of all moral and ethical concerns. Those who were against us, well, if you weren’t there, it would be hard for you to imagine what they had done to us. 

“Are you ready Keith?” Beatty’s voice came above my head. 

“Yes I am.” I answered. And of course, we both knew that none of what I was experiencing was real yet. But it was my daily task. Our mission. They needed to be performed daily to make sure we would be prepared. 

“Three, two, one.” Beatty executed the release command, and my body was given a upright downwards push. I submerged into the purple water in no time, watching it covering above my own head. I slightly raised my head to look up at the surface. It was darkening and the refracted light looked so beautiful before its vanishing.
