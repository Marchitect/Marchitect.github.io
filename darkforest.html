#the Dark Forest Theory of the Universe

##Basic Rules:
1. Survival is the utmost purpose of any civilisation.
2. While the total amount of substance in the universe stays unchanged, any civilisation can grow at an exponential rate. 

###From the basic rules, we can derive that the resources in the universe are not enough for all existing civilisations. It can also be concluded that the technology of any civilisation can be developed exponentially. The singularity could happen anytime. When two civilisations meet each other, for each side it is not rational to presume the other side is safe now and in the future, and to presume the other side won't attack first. Therefore, at some point, there would be killing. 

##The Ultimate Weapons In A Three-Dimensional Space:
1. the "Light Bullet": A block of substance with a small size but the speed of light. It is aimed at the centre of a star and will cause the extermination of this star and its surrounding planets, etc. 
2. the "Two-Dimensionalise Foil": A piece of a two-dimension space tossed to a star system. It will two-dimensionalise all substances in the three-dimensional space, including all life forms. 

##How To Survive In Such An Universe Under The Dark Forest Theory:
1. Do not send signals to the outer space.
2. Hide your planet with surrounding space that slows down the lightspeed. This surrounding space works similar to the black hole. In this way your civilisation can never escape from your own planet, let alone your star system. For other dangerous civilisations out there ready to kill, they can observe this surrounding space where lights travels slower than normal, and this acts as a safety declaration claiming that this civilisation will never send any spaceships out of its territory to kill or to colonize.
3. Invent curvature-driven spaceships, so you can either run away from an attack or wonder in the universe and be the killer. 
4. To cope with the two-dimensionalise foil, a civilisation needs to be capable to de-dimensionalise itself. Otherwise, someday the 2D space will expand and terminate the civilisation who tossed a two-dimensionalise foil in the very beginning. 

##Others:
The universe might be a 10D one at first, slowly it is de-dimensionalised and will shrink to the minimal and then explode to become a new universe again. 

###:D just for fun.
