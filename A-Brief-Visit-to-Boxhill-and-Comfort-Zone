I have been in Melbourne for about 11 months now and this afternoon, for the first time I visited the shopping centre of Boxhill. It is connected with the train line and surprisingly (or maybe not?) it is a place full of life, businesses, chattering and Asian faces. I almost felt like I was in China - a bit crowded, some people with bearable fashion taste (like I have any), and the rude Asian stares at me and Charles (to defend that I'll say Chinese people are nosy and they don't want to pretend they are not).

There are Asian restaurants, grocery shops, food stores, and fashion shops everywhere. Of course I also found a real estate agency stall. The most amazing thing of this visit is that my homesickness got healed in no time. I think that visiting the shopping centre of Boxhill once in a while would be much better than visiting any real psychologist. I do know that it is great to embrace the pluralistic culture here in Australia, but homesickness is like a mental disease that calls for proper attention.

Personally I feel like some 'real' Aussies who are surrounded by Asian faces could be feeling what I was feeling when I walk in a Kmart shop surrounded by 'real' Aussie families. I think that they should be feeling very glad that there aren't any seemingly undereducated Asian teenagers who would yell at the 'real' Aussies with some words and phrases in a language they couldn't even fully understand.

The reason I went to Boxhill centre is that I got recommended a Korean fried chicken restaurant by a colleague who loves K-pop. I really want to express my thanks to her, although she didn't know this brand of fried chicken franchise also has a branch in Boxhill when she recommended this to me. On my lead, Charlie and I basically tried our best to act like real Koreans (the Southern kind), binging on 3 different flavours of fried chicken and one pint of beer for each. Sadly I forgot to order Korean beer, will try next time.

I was very glad to find that the Korean spicy favour fried chicken tastes pretty similar to the kind of sweet and spicy favoured food I love in my hometown city. Due to historical and geographical reasons, the food culture in my hometown carries a Korean fusion. I believe it is safer to say it is a fusion rather than legitimate Korean food, unless the owner of the restaurant is from Korea.

Charles managed to speak some Mandarin sentences with me because I managed to convince him that I could't tell if there were any customers in the restaurant who could understand Mandarin. He couldn't stop dramatically criticising how a fried chicken flavour we ordered tasted, comparing it to shit and saying it was disgusting. I actually loved that flavour but at the same time I guess I should feel very proud that he learnt how to say 'food tastes like shit and is disgusting' in Mandarin.

The visit of Boxhill ended with me feeling excited. We walked around in the shopping centre and by the end were feeling a bit lost in the maze-like shopping centre. We managed to get out of the building and found our way to where we entered the car park and then found the car from there.

I would like to briefly discuss the idea of a 'comfort zone' to live and improve in a pluralistic cultural background. It is more comfortable to stay in that 'comfort zone' for sure. I have seen so many ethnic groups choosing to stay comfortable with people inside their group. Personally I do feel that life is not easy being a ethnic minority in another environment you are not familiar with. You can feel lonely, frustrated and homesick. Through bravery, struggle, communication, luck, the encouragement and love of others - all these will help you grow to be a better human being and gain more knowledge about the the world and of yourself. Same as the way we deal with other obstacles in life, winning over it is better than withdrawing.

*Thanks Charles for the proof reading.*
