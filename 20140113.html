Hobart. Another day ended 51 minutes ago. I was lying in my bed, thoughts and ideas kept appearing in my mind one by one. These ideas were mainly about possible plots in my sci-fi writing, one way to improve my writing method & organise all my writing-related materials, a kind of software or application that could be developed and some other stuff I hadn't finished yesterday.

Then I jumped out of my bed, and in the dark I walked to the desk. My mouse gave out faint red light. I found my glasses and opened the lamp. Now I am typing these sentences and I decide to practice all the ideas that appeared half an hour ago as much as I can at midnight. I have sometimes stupid and boring language classes this morning but I don't care.

Today, I make a promise to myself. If I have an idea, I will capture it, I will do as much as I can about it immediately. Otherwise ideas will fade away.

Many ideas may prove to fail. However, I know some of my ideas are worth a try. I know many people in the IT & CS field have dreams, dreams to change and beautify the world at least a little bit with technology and innovation. What I don't know – and they may not know – is how someone would really strive for at least one idea, whether it proves to fail or to succeed in the end.

But now, I want to know. Now and ever.
