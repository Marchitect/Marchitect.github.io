I almost kept still, and I kept going down, controlling my lungs. The surroundings were turning darker and darker, while my cone cells were rapidly adjusting to the lessening available light. My vision was filled with the colour of violet, along with undersea creatures breaking into it at times: the swaying fronds of blue algae; a swift shoal of jadal fish, each having a round body in orange stripes; a slim silver ribbon fish who enjoys being a lone wolf. Eventually they all slowly rose up in my vision. The biologists in this project were really good at naming their new findings of species.

Finally, I had a feeling of both feet touching the ground. I adjusted my position from 'standing' upright to lying face down, almost swimming breaststroke. I stretch my arms forward, then smoothly stroked backwards, and then stretch out forward again. This repeats while my thighs were leading my lower legs, ankles and feet to swing up and down in a suitable range.

I raised my head a little bit and spot a task point about 300 metres ahead. I was only 4 or 5 centimetres away from the seabed. Brown daub, scattering gravel, seaweed-like plants and crawling sea creatures were all bright and clear in front of my eyes. Sadly the touch feel from the hand wasn't really programmed and simulated.

I continued to stroke my arms and dive on. I was thinking if I could just lie down under this water quietly, doing nothing. But this thought had never been put into action.

And every time when I dived in, all I did was just swimming ahead or at different directions with a rhythm. While I was enjoying the comfortable feel of touch from the water that flowed around me, I consciously control the shrinking and dilating of my lungs with the help of the auxiliary oxygen inhaling equipment, I raised, and I sank. The tasks we needed to do were simply scanning and uploading new findings, judging possible complex terrains around in order to avoid being stranded, as well as fleeing away from the very dangerous and challenging situation – saltwater invasion. After completing each task you would gain a virtual metal.

The times of my practicing was accumulated enough to make me feel somewhat bored from it.

This was actually the last simulation practice before we finally had the official launch. For three months the managing directors of VOPP hadn't set aside extra investment to design new terrains and tasks – they probably felt that it was unnecessary.

I swam over the entire rather flat seabed, and not far away from me was a huge and deeply sunken dark violet oceanic trench.

After I slowed down a bit and adjusted my breathing, I began diving down towards the deep of the trench. I glanced at the indicator. It showed me that my current depth was 92.7 metres, and 31 meters away from that task point. The density of water body on this planet was slightly lower than that of the oceans on the Earth.

None of this was real.

But my feelings and thoughts were. Similarly, my ponderously shrinking lungs (like three tiny and dry mangoes) when I dived in and right before I obtained my oxygen, were real.

I could not tell if I really enjoyed this diving and the feeling of gliding at the bottom of the ocean. This activity had already become as natural as breathing in the air for me.

Yes, I knew the diving I was doing was not real at all. It was just one part of the VOPP simulation training. Each genetic modified human that was in this project owned a VOP environment simulator. Therefore, at home they could train themselves anytime with their robots to put themselves into the simulated great ocean.

We were only one week away from heading towards the real violet ocean planet. We genetic modified humans along with our own robots would be assigned to different areas to explore and upload our findings. Each genetic modified human like us did not have any obstacles to complete the tasks alone – the help from a robot was good enough. It was said that we had relatively less need of socialising. That would probably be a result of genetic engineering too. However, none of us questioned this truth, nor confirmed if it was really true. For us, that kind of answers and details were needless to know. Even if we did learn about the truth, what is the point? It belonged to the part we couldn't change about our being.

And years ago, the thought did hit me, that what if we were not genetic modified humans, but just humans with the original body anatomy, how many possible ways of living would be in front of us?
